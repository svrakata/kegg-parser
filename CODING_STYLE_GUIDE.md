# Coding Style GUIDE for Bioseek --- it's time

* All file names should be written in [SNAKE CASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
* All variables and function names should be in [CAMEL CASE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
* We use typescript
* We use TDD. Boilerplate with TS and Jest [HERE](https://github.com/svrakata/node-typescript-boilerplate)
* Each functionality should be in separate module/separate file
* Don't use semicolons
* Use double quotes for string single quotes for char template literals for everything else
